Hi! Wow, look at me coding like a pro! Well, let me see. I'm a full time Graphic Designer and have been for what seems like forever. I'm also a wife and mother of an adorable one year old little boy named Orion.

I have a pretty wonderful life and I'm just ready for a change. I've always loved math so I thought I'd try my hand at programming.
